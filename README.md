## Movie Trailer Website

This is a movie preview web application. It allows the user to play the trailers for a list of movies by clicking on their posters.

### Prerequisites

This application requires Python 2.7 to be installed on the machine. You can download and install it by going to [Python's Website](https://www.python.org/downloads/).

### Installation

To run the application, you must download and have the following three files within the same directory on your machine:
- `fresh_tomatoes.py`
- `media.py`
- `entertainment_center.py`

To start the application, execute the `entertainment_center.py` file. This will create a `fresh_tomatoes.html` file within the same directory, a browser(or new tab if browser is open) will be started and the Movie Trailer Website will be displayed. If you make any changes to the code, you will not see them reflected in the `fresh_tomatoes.html` until the `entertainment_center.py` is executed again. Each time the application is run, a new `fresh_tomatoes.html` file is created.
